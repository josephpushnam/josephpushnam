## Hi there! I'm Joseph Pushnam (or J) üëã

After working in leading ecommerce brands, big 4s and startups I've learned an important truth about work **The learning curve is steep, and it doesn't always have to be mundane and boring.**

My favorite quote by **Simon Sinek** is...

_"Work hard, play hard" sounds terribly unhealthy. I think, we would all be a lot healthier, happier, and find greater balance in our lives if we learn to work smart and play always."_
